I've just learned the design pattern this semester,
    and I find that it's interesting and important.

But in course I learned the design pattern with Java,
    which has inheritance relationships.
As for Rust, it only have associative relationships(Java have it also).

So in order to deepen my understanding of design patterns,
    write some code to get familiar with Rust,
    and practice my ability of expression in English.

That's the project comes.
Finished:
    Simple Factory
    Factory Method
    Abstract Factory
    Builder Mode
